Mid Term apps:
1. simple player
2. a) dashcast clone (ffmpeg input)
   b) socket in, GPAC demux (MP4 or TS), DASH out

Tasks (from higher to lower priority):
- SDL and renderers should be able to run in thread 0
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20530218/check-if-current-thread-is-main-thread
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13287963/id-of-main-thread-in-c
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1969579/getting-a-handle-to-the-processs-main-thread
- investigate existing code compatibility (especially GStreamer code, see http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~thiagoss/gst-plugins-bad/log/?h=adaptivedemux)
- be able to draw the graph of connections (and allocator states?)
- allow multi-process with pipes (x264, MP4Box -dash-ctx, ...)
- some modules may still assume the first timestamp is zero...
- player example plugged with Qt
- GPAC TS demux and mux (for HLS)
- muxer example with two inputs of the same type (e.g. video)
- use operators (https://github.com/klmr/named-operator) to describe graphs as pipes?
- GUI: use angular.js? "gui, angular.js, end-point rest, agplv3" @Ffrenchm

Questions (from higher to lower priority):
- eligibility of tasks / ASIO scheduler?
- how to dynamically connect filters
- how to expose an interface to older compilers
- how to expose parameters so that we can plug it with a GUI?

DashCast:
- resolution as a param
- crop
- multi-rep
- DTSC support
- DASH GPAC input
- low latency -> allow fine-grain threading
- DASHer live should be injected a clock?
